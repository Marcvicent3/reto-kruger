# RetoKruger

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.6.


The adminlte template version 3 was used.
Angular was used for the frontend part and CodeIgniter for the backend part.

## Architecture

The architecture used was MVC connecting to the backend with the services generated by Angular.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

The restServices folder must be placed on a local server running on port 8080 for it to work.

In the same way the database located in the root must be imported.

## Notes
To log in to the system the administrator user and password is ADMIN.
